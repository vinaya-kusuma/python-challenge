Module 3 Assignment Submission

To complete this assignment, I did not work with a peer and did not receive any code outside the curriculum content from the support staff.
I have worked independently on this assignment.


In the PyPoll challenge, to get the winner with most number of votes, I have used the max function which returns the key with the highest value in a dictionary.I have referred to the following links

To run the PyBank and PyPoll challenges, I have made sure to 'select folder' as PyBank and PyPoll folders respectively to ensure  that the code executes without any error, especially the file not found error.

I have included the screenshots which display the results at the terminal.
